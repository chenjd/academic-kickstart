Hi, I'm Jiadong Chen (@chen_jd). And I've been working for Unity as a Field Engineer since 2017.
I have participated in the Unite Conf(Beijing & Shanghai) twice as a speaker.

Before joining Unity, I was a game programmer and the organizer of the Beijing Unity User Group(UUG).
I like to write technical blogs (of course mostly in Chinese), and my first book about Unity was published in 2016. Besides, I got my first Microsoft MVP Award in 2015.
